Thank you for always being by my side, and no matter what I do, it will never be enough and it will never express my love. I hope that you have an amazing year, my love, and achieve everything you want to achieve, and I hope that our love grows more and more, my beautiful girl. Many more years to come, inshaa allah, the love of my life. I want you to know that I love and adore every little detail about you, from your laugh to your smile to the way you talk and speak and how mature you are, and I love being loved by you.
