  <h2 class="title-text">
    Happy birthday, my beautiful princess. I couldn't let something like this pass without doing something for you. Thank you for always being by my side, and no matter what I do, it will never be enough, and it will never fully express the depth of my love for you. I hope this year brings you incredible joy and opportunities and that you achieve all your goals, and I hope that our love grows more and more with each passing day, my beautiful girl. Many more years to come, Inshaa Allah, I want you to know that I love and adore every little detail about you, from your laugh to your smile to the way you talk and speak and how mature you are. I am truly lucky and grateful to be loved by you. And I want you to know that I couldn't be more proud of you and proud to be your husband, and I'm so proud that you are my girl. I love you to death, my baby, and wallah, you deserve the whole world, my angel. I was so happy while making this game, and I've been super excited to show it to you, so I hope that you liked and enjoyed it. I hope that you have a wonderful year.<br>My adorable girl. ‚ù£
